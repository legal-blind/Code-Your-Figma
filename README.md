Design Used:
For this assignment i decided to use the Balenciaga website as a reference point. The homepage has a clean layout with centered text, large images, and wide empty spaces. I recreated this style by keeping the background simple, using big images, and using minimal text. The two holiday images from the real site are included in the sections.

JavaScript Interactions:
1. Theme toggle changes the page between light and dark mode.
2. Email box checks for a valid email and shows a message under the button.
3. The images get a small scale-up effect when you hover over them.

Challenges:
Getting the layout to look clean took some time because the Balenciaga site has a lot of empty space and everything is centered. I had to adjust the spacing so the images didn’t feel like they were too close to the edges. And matching the text style also took a little tweaking because the real website uses thin serif fonts. Making the dark mode look smooth also took a few tests.

Extra Notes:
The site uses Flexbox for the navigation and simple responsive scaling on images. All files are separated into their own folders the way the assignment requires. The project stays simple on purpose so it looks close to the real site without trying to copy every detail(hopefully you like it!).
